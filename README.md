# CMPSC 302: Web Design

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

This repository provides the website for `CMPSC 302`, Web Design, at Allegheny College. It was used for the
Spring 2026 section. It is built using the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) docs template for
the [Astro](https://astro.build/) build platform.

This template also includes the `ReactJS` framework, for use during later stages in the course when discussing
integrating `components`. This language is common across React and Astro.
