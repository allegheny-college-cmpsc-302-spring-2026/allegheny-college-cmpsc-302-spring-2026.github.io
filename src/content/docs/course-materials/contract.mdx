For many of the reasons highlighted above, this course implements a _grading contract_. This contract is
informed by both classroom and real-world experience; very often the most transformative moments for 
learners happen outside of traditional `"yes"`-`"no"`, `"right"`-`"wrong"` structures. As such, your instructor has 
little interest in adjudicating absolutes. Given that your instructor largely learned by producing unsatisfactory 
and incorrect work, so will you. _Except_, you have an advantage: you can always _try again_. In the professional world, 
"do-over"s are limited. If you accept this invitation and make every attempt to improve, your work will
merit the credit it deserves.

## Grading Philosophy

Rising to the level of above-average or exceptional work relies on the just that: above-average or exceptional work. 
This contract should provide incentives to think beyond mere sufficiency. As you'll see below, work that aspires to 
higher levels of reward involves digging into the high-effort details that make modern web design workable. Often,
this means going beyond completion and achieving high levels finishing quality.

## Evaluation

This course contemplates three (3) primary ways of achieving learning objectives and outcomes:
<div class = "course-info-table">
    <div><span class = "info-label">Assessments</span></div>
    <div>
        Weekly
    </div>
    <div><span class = "info-label">Challenges</span></div>
    <div>
        Bi-weekly
    </div>
     <div><span class = "info-label">A Project</span></div>
    <div>
        Months-long, with interim due dates
    </div>
</div>

### Assessments

> <Icon name = "seti:clock" class = "icon-prepend" /> Weekly

Assessments represent short, targeted activities which evaluate learning on a specific core topic. These
will represent short technical interview components such as oral questions, short technical problems (solvable
within shorter periods of time), or requests to speculate on solutions to given design problems. While these may be 
somewhat cumulative (i.e., can incorporate previous content), their main goal is to examine understanding of topics
recently completed within the prior week's time. The majority of these will be individual assignments,
though some may be collaborative. The instructor will distinguish between these when assigning the challenge(s).

### Challenges

> <Icon name = "seti:clock" class = "icon-prepend" /> Bi-weekly

Longer-term technical challenges intend to simulate a "take-home" interview assignment. When assigned, each of these
challenges will be due one (1) week from the day they are assigned. These will occur every other week in the course
and evaluate learner's grasp of content from that time period. The majority of these will be individual assignments,
though some may be collaborative. The instructor will distinguish between these when assigning the challenge(s).

### Project Benchmarks

> <Icon name = "seti:clock" class = "icon-prepend" /> Monthly

The main goal of this course is to enable you to complete a single larger-scale personal portfolio project. Students may 
choose to display other types of projects from discplines including, but not limited to, computer science. While this
project occurs over the course of the entire semester, there will be periodic benchmarking assignments to assess 
student progress on the various planning and building tasks inherent in creating a complete, polished, personal website.
These benchmarks will be due on a monthly basis. This project constitutes an individual assignment.

### Grading Schedule

<GradingSchedule cols={frontmatter.columns} rows={frontmatter.levels} />

This course incorporates _effort_ and _process_ as its main evaluative metric. As such, you are 
encourged to make as many attempts as you wish to complete assignments. The number of attempts needed
to pass each benchmark will be averaged and _rounded down_. 

#### Achieving Benchmarks

To successfully achieve a benchmark, students must complete _all_ requirements of an assignment. These
will follow either a rubric or a set of Gatorgrader specifications. For example, challenges and assessments like 
presentations or interviews will follow published rubrics; challenges which require technical implementations will
include automated grading specifications. While this distinction is not wholly representative of the various
kinds of assignments in this course, be aware that each assignment will be accompanied by a set of grading
specifications, known to students at the time of assignment.

#### Averaging Benchmark Attempts

Benchmark averages will be calculated over the course of the semester, rounding _down_, using increments
of `.5` as the rounding factor.

For example, a student with the following profile:

<GradingSchedule cols={frontmatter.columns} rows={frontmatter.exampleLevels} />

would be evaluated as having achieved a `B` letter grade in the course.

#### Incomplete benchmarks

In the case of an incomplete benchmark, students will be assessed as having taken `6` attempts to complete it. This
evaluation will be incorporated into the average calculation of a student's progress toward a given metric.
