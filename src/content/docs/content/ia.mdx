This week, we meet a few design terms that help us both:

1. plan for what kinds of content we need to design for
2. understand the structure and connections between "places of information" on our portfolio

## Learning Objectives

This lesson addresses learning objectives:

3. Design front-end user experiences using accepted web design patterns, methods, and information structures.
4. Identify and use strategies of successful visual rhetoric for the web.

### Types of Thinking
In this course, we balance _two_ different kinds of thinking:
    <div class = "slide-grid-two-column" style = "align-items: unset;">
    <figure>
        <figcaption style = "line-height: unset; text-align: left;"><h4>Design Thinking</h4></figcaption>
        <Image 
            src={designThinking}
            alt="Design thinking diagram"
            loading="lazy"
        />
    </figure>
        <figure style = "margin-top: 0;">
        <figcaption style = "line-height: unset;"><h4>Systems Thinking</h4></figcaption>
        <Image 
            src={systemsThinking}
            alt="Systems thinking diagram"
            loading="lazy"
        />
    </figure>
    </div>
</Slide>
<Slide centered>
    #### Design Thinking vs. Systems Thinking
    <div class = "slide-grid-two-column" style = "align-items: unset;">
        <div>
            ##### Design Thinking
            - Human-centered, tangible, experimental, action-oriented
            - Foregrounds _empathy_ with people part of and impacted by the system
            - Considers audience needs and behaviors
            - Encourages prototyping with a high degree of risk-taking
        </div>
        <div style = "margin-top: 0;">
            ##### Systems Thinking
            - Relationships-based, where some actors _aren't_ human
            - Visualizes systems instead of individual actors
            - Concerned with root causes
            - Offers ability to see gaps or opportunities without thinking about _how_ to address them
        </div>
    </div>
</Slide>
<Slide>
    #### Humanity-centered Design

    In creating effective design, we use both kinds of thinking in a form called _Humanity-Centered Design_, whose
    steps are:

    <div class = "slide-grid-table-display">
        - <Image src={target} alt="Systems thinking diagram" loading="lazy"/>
            - ##### Discover and address the proper root cause
        - <Image src={gears} alt="Systems thinking diagram" loading="lazy"/>
            - ##### Design considering the whole system
        - <Image src={hourglass} alt="Systems thinking diagram" loading="lazy"/>
            - ##### Take the long view
        - <Image src={revise} alt="Systems thinking diagram" loading="lazy"/>
            - ##### Continuously refine and revise the product
        - <Image src={community} alt="Systems thinking diagram" loading="lazy"/>
            - ##### Design with respect to the communities involved
    </div>

###### Discover and Address the Proper Root Cause
<div class = "slide-grid-two-column" style = "grid-template-columns: 20% 80%;">
        <div>

            Our semester starts here with a single rhetorical problem:
            > The main goal of this course is to enable you to complete a single larger-scale personal portfolio project. 
            > Students may choose to display other types of projects from discplines including, but not limited to, 
            > computer science. While this project occurs over the course of the entire semester, there will be periodic 
            > benchmarking assignments to assess student progress on the various planning and building tasks inherent in 
            > creating a complete, polished, personal website.

            - What is the "root cause" of our problem?
            - How do we know it's the right one?
            - How do we propose to address it?
        </div>

|Term |Design implications                                             |
|:----|:-------------------------------------------------|
|personal portfolio | A portfolio is a kind of genre of communication; communication requires understanding audience and the various forms of communication they validate and accepts |
|disciplines        | Individual disiplines have their own conventions, requirements, evaluations and expectations; how do you meet yours? |
|complete           | Both a level of finish and a testing benchmark; various topics in this course will challenge this idea |
|polished           | Similar to `complete`ness, this is a testing benchmark and a clear understanding of conventions and practices |
|website            | Requires a particular set of tech and systems to implement and maintain; these are part of the design calculation |

    ### The Communication Problem
    <div class = "slide-grid-two-column" style = "align-items: unset;">
        <div>
            <figure>
                > we’re left with a nasty paradox: we’re forced to demonstrate the
                > value and essence of our work in a visual medium, though our work
                > itself isn’t especially visual.
            <figcaption>Rosenfeld, Morville, Arango, pp. 391</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <div>
        To solve this, we're starting with `Information Architectures` and `Content Inventories` for
        two (2) primary reasons. These are diagrams which:
        1. "define content components" (i.e. what a unit of content _is_)
        2. illustrate the connection between information and how it serves an audience
        </div>
    </div>

#### Content Inventory
    <figure>
    > breaking down or combining existing content into content chunks 
    > that are useful for inclusion in your environment. A content chunk 
    > isn’t necessarily a sentence or a paragraph or a page. Rather, it 
    > is the most finely grained portion of content that merits or requires
    > individual treatment
    <figcaption>Rosenfeld, Morville, Arango, pp. 415</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    A <dfn>content inventory</dfn> describes available content and where it can be found as well as content gaps that need to be filled.

        </figure>
    </div>
</Slide>

#### Sitemaps

We approach `Information Architecture` through a _sitemap_, a tool which:
<figure>
    > show[s] the relationships between information elements such
    > as pages and other content components, and can be used to portray
    > organization, navigation, and labeling systems. Both the diagram
    > and the navigation system display the “shape” of the information
    > space in overview, functioning as a condensed map for site developers 
    > and users, respectively.

            <Image src={contentMapping} alt="Content mapping tool screen capture" loading="lazy"/>

<Aside type = "note">Allegheny College students enrolled in the `CMPSC 302: Web Design` course
have already been given invitations to Figma.</Aside>

To complete these exercises, students have been given a `FigJam` template to complete. FigJam
is a whiteboarding tool similar to `tl;draw` and `Excalidraw`, but offers many more design-specific
features. It is also an industrially-relevant and widely-used tool for planning, collaborating and,
as we'll see in the next lesson, wireframing.
