Over the course of a couple activities and working in Figma, we'll begin to develop the
physical structure and appearance of our portfolio sites.

## Learning Objectives

This lesson addresses learning objectives:

3. Design front-end user experiences using accepted web design patterns, methods, and information structures.
4. Identify and use strategies of successful visual rhetoric for the web.

<div class = "slide-grid-two-column">
    <div>
        <Image 
            src={simpleFrame}
            alt="Complex wireframe on graph paper"
            loading="lazy"
        />
    </div>
    <div style = "margin-top: 0px;">
        ### Sketching
        * Provides a low-fidelity, rapid prototype
        * Creates a situation on which designers can quickly revise/translate abstract concepts
        * Contributes to faster, lower-stakes ideation
        * Develops a clearer conceptual foundation for final wireframes
        * Easy to develop multiple "looks" per page and compare them
    </div>
</div>

#### Rules for Sketching
* Focus only on major elements
  * Do not add detail like wording unless it's a major-level heading, or similar
* Show actions or movement through arrows or other clear indicator
* Build each sketch in _layers_
  * Add the overall framing elements, then the next important, and so on
* Add interactions with post-it note instructions
* Photocopy your best sketches to create a platform on which to iterate
* Make multiple sketches for each page
* Make notes _on_ the sketches

Ultimately, follow something close to a _design thinking_ process for this step:
<div class = "slide-grid-table-display-three">
    - <Image src={ideate} alt="Systems thinking diagram" loading="lazy"/>
        - ##### Devise
    - <Image src={compare} alt="Systems thinking diagram" loading="lazy"/>
        - ##### Compare
    - <Image src={revise} alt="Systems thinking diagram" loading="lazy"/>
        - ##### Take Notes
</div>

#### Activity: Sketching

##### Warmup

Below, you'll find a wireframe of WebCo's main page. WebCo sells widgets, but their site
doesn't do that so well. 

Your job is two-fold:

1. Sketch the current layout
2. Provide an alternate view that foregrounds the three different types of widgets they have

<Image src={warmup} alt="Systems thinking diagram" loading="lazy" style = "margin: 1rem auto;"/>

##### The Real Deal

Using your current page Information Architectures for guidance, make `3` sketches
of each of the pages that you plan to create. In some ways, this may help clarify
how you plan to organize your content: no one wants to draw `7` separate page layouts
when `3` will do.

Using the paper provided, sketch potential layouts for your content, keeping our guidelines
in mind.

    ### Wireframing
    * more precise than sketching
    * often shared with front-end developers, but _not_ clients
    * minimal color and design embellishments
    * purpose is to get design from paper-to-digital quickly
    </div>
    <div style = "margin-top: 0px;">
        <Image 
            src={wireFrame}
            alt="A simple wireframe"
            loading="lazy"
        />
    </div>

#### Tips for Wireframing

* begin the process only when your design goals are clear
* design for the right sizes
  * for this course, we're concentrating on Desktop and Mobile
* use the process to develop consistent design "rules"
  * e.g., all images are `x` width apart, and `y` units separated from headings
* develop _components_ when you encounter a control or block you plan to reuse
* do not become overly attached to your wireframes; they will change
</Slide>

#### Tools for wireframing

![Figma logo](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/59e16042ec229e00016d3a66/64309e7ce733f37f0a4c0880_Figma-rebrand-assets_Blog-hero.avif)

As with our [information architecture](/content/ia), we're going to use `Figma`, an
industry-standard design software.

#### Activity: Wireframing
<div class = "slide-grid-two-column">
    <div style = "margin-top: 0px;">
        <Image src={warmup} alt="Systems thinking diagram" loading="lazy" style = "margin: 1rem auto;"/>
    </div>

    For practice, let's try to recreate the wireframe pictured above. Below, you'll find some
    resources for doing just that.
