`astro` is a framework that allows us to remove some of the difficulties of writing a functional,
accessible HTML site. We use this framework in our course to speed up our learning and provide
exposure to modern web design practices and technologies.

For more on installing `astro` and supporting tooling, see the [astro template](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-302-spring-2026/astro-template)
available in this course's Github organization.

To effectively use and _own_ this repository, instructional staff suggests that you `fork` the repo.
* On the resulting page, in the `Owner` drill-down, choose your personal Github account
* Name the repository `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io`
  * `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io` is a special repository, which
  * creates a repository at the above easy-to-access URL

## Learning Objectives

1. Apply HTML, CSS, Markdown, and basic Javascript to develop well-structured, responsive World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards-compliant web sites.
2. Evaluate and implement web accessibility measures consistent with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2 specification.
3. Design front-end user experiences using accepted web design patterns, methods, and information structures.
4. Identify and use strategies of successful visual rhetoric for the web.
5. Compare and select web technologies such as static site generators or frameworks as appropriate candidates for building web sites.

<Aside>
This textbook serves as a good way to gain an approachable entry to learning HTML. While we
may do some limited exercises from the book, we will more likely use it purely as a basic element
reference.

Astro uses four primary file types to construct static websites. These are:
* `md` (Markdown)
* `mdx` (Extensible Markdown)
* `astro` (Astro component files)
* `ts` (Typescript component files)

For our purposes, we'll largely work with `mdx` files, an example of which looks like our
example of HTML from the [previous lesson](/content/html):

```html
---
// Frontmatter
---
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
		<title>Astro</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Astro</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

</Slide>

<Slide centered>
### The `mdx` preamble
<div class = "slide-grid-two-column" style = "align-items: unset;">
<div>
```yaml
---
// Frontmatter
---
```
</div>
<div>
This section, the `preamble`, allows developers to ingest and pass data between files. This allows:
* use of limited Typescript (a strongly-typed version of Javascript) to pass values
* creation of `partials`, template pieces that work together to make reusable components
* increased ability to maintain pages that share similar elements
</div>
</div>
</Slide>

<Slide>
To start our design, we will concentrate on `.astro` files, mainly working in `HTML`.

|File type |Markdown supported |HTML supported |
|:---------|:------------------|:--------------|
|`.astro`  |No                 |Yes            |
|`.md`     |Yes                |Yes, but not recommended        |
|`.mdx`    |Yes                |Yes            |

<div class = "slide-grid-two-column" style = "align-items: unset;">
<div>
#### `.astro` files

These constitute the main files for `components`. In this case, we're interested in:
* reusable sections
* creating maintainable layouts
* HTML-powered semantic structure
* implementing custom elements with full control over page structure
</div>
<div>
#### `.mdx` files

We use `mdx` files for pure `content`. In this case, we're interested in:
* ease of maintaining content
* overall maintainability, especially for those not interested in diving into HTML/elements
* retaining some power over/use of HTML elements where necessarily
* allowing others to use our layouts as `theme`s
</div>
</div>
</Slide>

<Slide>
#### Components

Either `.astro` or `.mdx` files can implement `components`, the heart of the `astro` build
platform. Consider again our main index page for our current template site:

```html
<!Doctype html>
<html lang="en">
	<!-- This is common to all pages, but maybe the title isn't -->
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<title>Astro</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- TODO: Add a nav? -->

		<!-- main body content might be a reusable component in this layout -->
        <main>
            <h1>Astro</h1>
        </main>

		<!-- TODO: Add a footer? -->
	</body>
</html>
```
</Slide>

<Slide>
Implementing components allows us to learn a little bit more about our file structure
and gain some insight into how `astro` works. Here, we're going to add a few components
and a layout.

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│   |   └── index.astro
│   └── layouts/
│       └── BaseLayout.astro
│   └── components/
│       └── Footer.astro
│       └── Header.astro
│       └── Nav.astro
```
The `pages` folder constitutes the `route`s that our site offers, and right now it has a single
`index` file, which responds at `/`, the lowest level of the URL hierarchy of our site. As we
add different components, we will change how that file is structured, though not much about 
its design.

To follow along with changes made, head to [dluman.github.io](dluman.github.io) to check out
how the files are coming together.

#### Mixing `Markdown` and `HTML`
<div class = "slide-grid-two-column" style = "align-items: unset;">
<div>
This course uses `astro` to implement our webpages. This means that we will use _both_ `Markdown` _and_
`HTML` to create pages: mostly in terms of headings, lists, and paragraphs. More specific HTML formatting
that goes beyond simple document construction will rely on writing HTML directly in our files.

The following table lists Markdown tags that their HTML equivalents:
</div>
|Markdown Tag |HTML Tag |
|:------------|:--------|
|`#` - `######`|`<h1>`-`<h6>` |
|`*`           |`<ul>`, `<li>`|
|`1.`...       |`<ol>`, `<li>`|
|Markdown table|`<table>` |
|`![]()`         |`<img />` |
|`[]()`          |`<a>`     |
|`>`             |`<blockquote>`|
|`**...**`       |`<strong>...</strong>`|
|`_..._`         |`<em>...</em>` |
|`---`           |`<hr />` |
|Backticks       |`<pre>`|
|Code fence      |`<code>`|
</div>
