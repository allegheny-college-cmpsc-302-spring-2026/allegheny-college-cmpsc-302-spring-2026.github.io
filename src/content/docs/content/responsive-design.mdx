The web long predated the myriad devices that we now use to access information on the internet. To accommodate
the proliferation of different devices and screens, the CSS spec introduced a feature known as a `media query`
to address screens of different resolutions. As Bryce Watson and Michael Woo remind us:

> Perhaps creating a responsive app is not high on your team's priority list right now. 
> But one day it will be — and the conversion time frame might be very tight when that day comes.
>
> Ideally, all you need to do is add media query CSS and everything just works. But the only way that 
> can happen is if the code readily adapts to responsive changes.

## Learning Objectives

1. Apply HTML, CSS, Markdown, and basic Javascript to develop well-structured, responsive World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards-compliant web sites.
2. Evaluate and implement web accessibility measures consistent with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2 specification.
3. Design front-end user experiences using accepted web design patterns, methods, and information structures.
4. Identify and use strategies of successful visual rhetoric for the web.
5. Compare and select web technologies such as static site generators or frameworks as appropriate candidates for building web sites.

This textbook serves as a good way to gain an approachable entry to learning HTML. While we
may do some limited exercises from the book, we will more likely use it purely as a basic element
reference.

### Responsive web design

By itself, HTML is responsive as long as the page can determine the `viewport` width. However, choices that
a browser may make can be surprising or unhelpful. CSS helps ensure uniformity between device types, but _only_
if HTML can establish the `viewport`
```html
<head>
  ...
  <!-- This line ensures the browser can determine the viewport -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
</head>
```
Keep in mind that responsive design is not a separate technology: it is a method. Responsive design uses CSS
with appropriate semantic HTML groups to effect designs that work across devices such as phones and even watches.

#### Media queries

CSS achieves responsiveness through `media query` directives. For example, the WebCo site uses:
```txt
@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {

  nav {
     grid-column: span 2;
  }
  
  .full__three_column, .full__four_column {
    display: flex;
    flex: 1;
    flex-direction: column;
    row-gap: 3rem;
    column-gap: 0;
  }

  .article__border_right:not(:last-of-type) {
    border-right: none;
  }

  #search {
    display: none;
  }

}
```
</Slide>

<Slide>
This query sets the following restrictions:
* media type must be a `screen`
* the viewport must attain a `max-width` of `767px`

The `and` between the media type (`screen`) and the pixel-denoted width means that 
_both_ of these must be true.

At one time, more media types existed, but these have been deprecated and the available
media types list is now:

|Media type| Meaning |
|:---------|:--------|
|`screen`  | All devices that aren't requesting `print` |
|`print`   | Devices requesting `print` layouts |
|`all`     | All media regargless of requests |

Note that the `and` operator exists. Developers may also use:
* `not`
* `only`
* `or`

While we're going to focus on usability via design elements, know that media queries can
cover [much more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@media).

#### `flex`ing

Grids are great for `2`-dimensional layouts that need to control both horizontal and vertical
layouts. However, what happens when we want to do a layout in only one direction? Let's return
to our WebCo layout.
</Slide>

<Slide>
There are a number of different positioning strategies, particularly the effect of:
```txt
 .full__three_column, .full__four_column {
    display: flex;
    flex: 1;
    flex-direction: column;
    row-gap: 3rem;
    column-gap: 0;
  }
```
<div class = "slide-grid-two-column" style = "align-items: unset">
    <div style = "max-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><Image 
    src={BaseLayout}
    alt="WebCo layout"
    loading="lazy"
    /></div>

    <div style = "max-height: 46vh; overflow-y: scroll;"><Image 
    src={responsiveLayout}
    alt="WebCo layout"
    loading="lazy"
    /></div>
</div>
</Slide>
<Slide>
In the above, we _overrule_ the `display: grid` set at the desktop level and substitute in `display: flex`
with an additional `2` parameters: `flex-direction: column` and `flex: 1`, letting the browser know
to flex vertically taking up `1` column.

This is what it means to _cascade_ in a style sheet: more specific rules _add to_ or _replace_ less specific
ones (namely in order of `selector` specificity or even order in the stylesheet).
</Slide>

#### `position`ing

To add a stick wicket to the proceedings, the way that we position items relative to each other plays
in to creating usable design. CSS accommodates a number of postiions:

|Position value |Meaning |
|:--------------|:-------|
|`absolute`     |Element supercedes the normal document flow, attaching to the closest positioned ancestor|
|`relative`     |Element positioned as listed in hierarchy, but is then _offset against itself_|
|`static`     |Element is positioned _exactly_ in the document hierarchy as written|
|`fixed`     |Element is removed from the document flow, then positioned against the `viewport`|
|`sticky`    |Element positions itself in the document flow, but "sticks" to its nearest ancestor with scrollable properties (usually the `viewport`|
