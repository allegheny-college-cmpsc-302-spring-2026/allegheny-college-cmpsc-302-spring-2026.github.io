`HTML` (Hypertext Markup Language) provides the "skeleton" of your website, the underlying
structure and hierarchy for information. Other similar languages like `Markdown` or `RST`
do the same thing. In essence, it organizes your pages. `CSS`, on the other hand _styles_
these pages.

## Learning Objectives

1. Apply HTML, CSS, Markdown, and basic Javascript to develop well-structured, responsive World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards-compliant web sites.
2. Evaluate and implement web accessibility measures consistent with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2 specification.
3. Design front-end user experiences using accepted web design patterns, methods, and information structures.
4. Identify and use strategies of successful visual rhetoric for the web.
5. Compare and select web technologies such as static site generators or frameworks as appropriate candidates for building web sites.

<Aside>
This textbook serves as a good way to gain an approachable entry to learning HTML. While we
may do some limited exercises from the book, we will more likely use it purely as a basic element
reference.

<div class = "slide-grid-two-column" style = "align-items: unset;">
    <div>
    ### <dfn>Semantics</dfn>
    > ...refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", 
    > or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
    </div>
    <div>
    ### <dfn>Design</dfn>
    > ...the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online to create the look, feel, and functionality of a website

        ### HTML
        * provides _semantic structure_ for content
        * creates a hierarchy
        * divides pages into `element`s by using `tag`s
        * has implications for meaning rather than solely for design
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSS-Next/logo.css/main/css.svg" style = "height: 64px; margin: 0 auto;" />
        ### CSS
        * provides _design_ and (limited) interactivity for information
        * creates a cohesive, visual design languages
        * uses `selector`s to affect particular `element`s of a page
        * is concerned with _aesthetic_ content rather that _semantic_ meaning

### The Role of HTML

Proposed in 1980 by the legend [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee),
HTML's current specification started to emerge in 1991 with the creation of a proposal for `18` `element`s,
though it would take until 1993 for a formal specification.

HTML rests on a few principles:
* HTML creates _documents_, which have
* limited base interactivity, largely meant to
* connect and provide context for information, rendered
* in a software referred to as a _browser_

HTML _can_:
* embed scripting languages such as `Javascript`
* use `Cascading Style Sheets` (`CSS`)
* include media such as images or video
* use interactive forms to provide or change web content
</Slide>


<Slide>
### Markup

The `Markup` portion of `HTML` means that the language uses `tag`s to _annotate_ information,
that is: HTML provides additional information _about_ the information presented. This can include:
* content type
* content role
* information hierarchy
* links to content
* inclusion of additional page resources, including, but not limited to:
  * hypermedia
  * stylesheets
  * scripts

#### `Tag`s

Tags constitute the method of annotation. In all, there exist `142` distinct tags. Many
feature additional `properties` which provide specific, context-based, information about 
the information they annotate. Tags are:
* surrounded by `<` and `>` symbols
* case-insensitive, though convention dictates lower-case usage, e.g. `<title>` vs. `<TITLE>`
* some are "self-closing," while others require closing tags around information, e.g.:
  * `<strong>Text</strong>` producing <strong>Text</strong>
  * `<br />` which produces <br/> a line break
</Slide>

<Slide>
#### `Element`s

`Tag`s create `element`s. The term `element`, then, refers to both the information included in the
`element` and the `tag`(s) that characterize that information. For example:
```html
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
Etiam venenatis libero eget nisl hendrerit, 
et elementum nisl cursus.</p>
```
is refered to as a paragraph `element` and is rendered:
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
Etiam venenatis libero eget nisl hendrerit, 
et elementum nisl cursus.</p>

Images are examples of "self-closing" tags that create elements (referred to as `void element`s in
the literature). An example:
```html
<img 
    src="https://placecats.com/100/100" 
    width = "100" 
    height = "100" 
    alt = "A pair of cute cats" 
/>
```
Rendered as:
<img 
    src="https://placecats.com/100/100" 
    width = "100" 
    height = "100" 
    alt = "A pair of cute cats" 
/>
</Slide>

<Slide>
In the case of our `img` element, we notice several different _properties_:
* `src`
* `width`
* `height`
* `alt`

While the kinds of properties available depend largely on the `tag`/`element` itself, here:

|Property |Meaning |
|:--------|:-------|
|`src`    |Source for image, typically a `URL` (relative _or_ absolute) |
|`width`  |Specified image width, in pixels    |
|`height` |Specified image height, in pixels   |
|`alt`    |Alternative text to display if image doesn't load _and_ for accessibility tools like screen readers |

</Slide>

As for the `tag`s that create `element`s, it's unlikely that a developer will ever use _all_ of them, at least
in a single page. However, the list below provides a concise view of the most common:

`<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<a>`, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, `<details>`, 
`<img>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`

Each has a _default_ representation in a _browser_, as the brower's job is to render content, even if it's not
necessarily valid HTML. We override this default view using a `stylesheet` (`CSS`), which takes the place of
a given browser's "root" stylesheet.

Most of the above are _not_ `void elements`, so they require content and closing tags.

<Slide>
### Beginning a Page

The first step to creating a given page is to develop it as a `document`, using a structure like that below. The
HTML below includes _comments_ to describe the various parts.

```html
<!-- Set the document type to HTML -->
<!Doctype html>
<!-- Create the root element -->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- Create page metadata, known as the "head" -->
	<head>
    <!-- Add metadata like character set, screen size, and page title -->
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<title>Astro</title>
	</head>
  <!-- Create visible body of the page -->
	<body>
        <!-- Designate the following as the main content of the page -->
        <main>
            <!-- Include a heading on the page -->
            <h1>Astro</h1>
        </main>
	</body>
<!-- Close the root element, end the page -->
</html>
```
</Slide>

#### Things to Keep in Mind

While we're not into how we _style_ pages yet, it's worth knowing that how you organize
the information on your page _can_ affect styling. For example:
```html
<img 
    src="https://placecats.com/200/200" 
    width = "200" 
    height = "200" 
    alt = "A cat with a banana" 
/>
<img 
    src="https://placecats.com/199/199" 
    width = "199" 
    height = "199" 
    alt = "A cat staring directly at the viewer" 
/>
```
<img 
    src="https://placecats.com/200/200" 
    width = "200" 
    height = "200" 
    alt = "A cat with a banana" 
/>
<img 
    src="https://placecats.com/199/199" 
    width = "199" 
    height = "199" 
    alt = "A cat staring directly at the viewer" 
/>
Browsers render content like a program's flow-of-control: top-to-bottom, left-to-right. Repositioning
these elements in `CSS` is _possible_, but potentially changes the meaning of the page, and might
cause some accessibility issues for assistive technologies that don't render CSS. If the above were two
related steps to a process, it's possible that the reader has gotten them backwards!
</Slide>

<Slide>
Similarly, designers should arrange content in a hierarchical view on a page. For example:
```html
<h1>A major heading</h1>
A really big point.
<h2>A sub-heading</h2>
A medium point related to the big point.
<h1>A sub-sub heading</h1>
A small point, I want to relate to the medium point. 
Look, I just wanted it to be big.
```
<h1>A major heading</h1>
A really big point.
<h2>A sub-heading</h2>
A medium point related to the big point.
<h1>A sub-sub heading</h1>
A small point, I want to relate to the medium point. 
Look, I just wanted it to be big.

The above would cause problems, as the page says that the second `<h1>` should be at the same level 
as a top-level point in the hierarchy. This confuses the information structure.
