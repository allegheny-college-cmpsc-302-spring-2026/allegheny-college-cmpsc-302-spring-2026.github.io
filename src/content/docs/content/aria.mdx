If `HTML` provides the _semantic content_ of a site, CSS works to provide emphasis on visual
hierarchy and aesthetic elements. While not necessarily _informational content_, using CSS well
should enhance your ability to make a visual argument in the form of a web site. In addition,
CSS can make or break the _accessibility_ of a site.

## Learning Objectives

1. Apply HTML, CSS, Markdown, and basic Javascript to develop well-structured, responsive World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards-compliant web sites.
2. Evaluate and implement web accessibility measures consistent with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2 specification.
3. Design front-end user experiences using accepted web design patterns, methods, and information structures.
4. Identify and use strategies of successful visual rhetoric for the web.
5. Compare and select web technologies such as static site generators or frameworks as appropriate candidates for building web sites.

<Aside>
This textbook serves as a good way to gain an approachable entry to learning HTML. While we
may do some limited exercises from the book, we will more likely use it purely as a basic element
reference.

While ARIA is widely supported by modern browsers, developers should prefer using the correct semantic HTML 
element over using ARIA, if such an element exists. For instance, native elements have built-in keyboard accessibility, 
roles and states. However, if you choose to use ARIA, you are responsible for mimicking the equivalent browser behavior 
in script.

### ARIA

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) `roles` and `attributes` allow elements which depart from the
truly semantic web to gain semantic and functional relevance for `a11y`.

First, some vocabulary:

|Term |Purpose |
|:----|:-------|
|`role`|Adds semantic meaning to an element which does not have any inherent sematics |
|`attributes`|Allows modification of element states and properties with respect to assistive technologies |

</Slide>

#### ARIA "rules"

As defined by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/):

1. Use native semantic elements first, only using ARIA where these elements don't exist, or accessibility features are not supported.
2. Do not change native semantic elements unless absolutely necessarily
3. All ARIA controls must be usable with keyboard control
4. Accessible elements must have an accessible name
5. ARIA attributes or roles added to parent elements will characterize child elements unless others are added at a lower level

##### ARIA roles

For example:

<Aside type = "danger" title="Do Not">
```html
<h2 role = tab>Tabbed Heading</h2>
```
</Aside>

<Aside title="Do">
```html
<div role = tab><h2>Tabbed Heading</h2></div>
```
</Aside>

For more on the available ARIA roles, see the [original spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#aria-roles) and information
on [per element usage](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance).

##### ARIA attributes

Attributes describe the states and properties of an element. Broadly speaking, defining these in HTML
means using sensible default values representing _initial_ states, changing these when scripts alter
their values in the course of page use.

<Aside type = "caution">
Some assistive technologies do not use Javascript. This means that a developers can't always rely
on being able to change attributes or properties. In this case, choose reasonable
starting states that accurately and helpful model content without assuming that users can change
its orientation, sorting, state, et al.
</Aside>


For a full list of states, properties, and values, have a look at [this excellent Github repo](https://github.com/filipelinhares/WAI-ARIA-cheatsheet?tab=readme-ov-file#state-and-properties).
