If `HTML` provides the _semantic content_ of a site, CSS works to provide emphasis on visual
hierarchy and aesthetic elements. While not necessarily _informational content_, using CSS well
should enhance your ability to make a visual argument in the form of a web site. In addition,
CSS can make or break the _accessibility_ of a site.

## Learning Objectives

1. Apply HTML, CSS, Markdown, and basic Javascript to develop well-structured, responsive World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards-compliant web sites.
2. Evaluate and implement web accessibility measures consistent with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2 specification.
3. Design front-end user experiences using accepted web design patterns, methods, and information structures.
4. Identify and use strategies of successful visual rhetoric for the web.
5. Compare and select web technologies such as static site generators or frameworks as appropriate candidates for building web sites.

<Aside>
This textbook serves as a good way to gain an approachable entry to learning HTML. While we
may do some limited exercises from the book, we will more likely use it purely as a basic element
reference.
